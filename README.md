# Resolver Capability Testbed

### Introduction

Currently, the DNS community has limited visibility of the capabilities and deployed features of the millions of
recursive resolvers in use across the internet. A helpful source of data has been provided by APNIC over the last decade
or so by the use of Google Ads but it has been felt that having alternative more accessible methods of collecting this
data would be advantageous and provide more flexibility going forward.

The DNS Research Federation have been commissioned by ICANN OCTO to develop an open source testbed suitable for use by
organisations with high query traffic, utilising popular open source DNS and Web servers to facilitate the testing of
Resolver Capabilities and rational collection of data for analysis. The intention is to provide a good range of DNS
feature tests out of the box to allow organisations to perform specific feature testing for themselves as well as to
encourage contribution of general data trends to the wider community.
